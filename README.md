Workshop On Software Engineering Project - 2018/Spring


This course is the last preperation for the engineering project of the 4th year of the Software Engineering Program at Ben Gurion Universiy, Israel.
The course is going through 5 iterations. Each iteration is focused on a diffrent aspect of software engineering.
In the course we built a web application that is a shopping website (similar to Ebay, Amazon, etc.).

## The course's iterations

## About The Course
> This course is about implementing a software engineering project, using SE methodologies and principles taught in other courses, and using modern software technologies. The course
functions as an SE-lab, where the students cope with a demanding SE task in a guided manner. The lab mimics a natural SE-development task, where usage of SE procedures is valuable and
productive. It embodies the following features: 
> - Adopt an agile development approach.
> - Maintenance challenges: Create a natural environment of successive changes due to complex evolution.
> - Enable a thoughtful non-naÃ¯ve customer (course staff), that plan intentionally complex requirements.
> - Insist on product validation.
> - Enforce SE-systematic development, including models, validation, testing, requirements analysis and reliability.
> - Cope with technology challenges.
> - Structured teamwork.

> The goal of the lab is to acquire experience in using SE methodologies, methods and technologies.
